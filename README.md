ProcessTracker - Python
-----------------------
Data integration process management made easy!

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/OpenDataAlex/process_tracker_python/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/OpenDataAlex/process_tracker_python?branch=master)

This is the Python implementation of the ProcessTracker framework.  ProcessTracker builds a standard framework that is
tool agnostic.  If you are working with data integration/cleansing processes within Python (i.e. using PySpark, Pandas, etc.)
then this framework can help manage dependencies between processes and provide auditing capabilities without having to
parse logs or build your own framework.

To learn more about how to use ProcessTracker, please check out our documentation on [ReadTheDocs][1]!
